Hi Lindsey,

Thanks for the opportunity to stay at your place. My two
kids (ages 8 & 10) and I are coming to Minneapolis (from
Omaha) in June to watch the Olympic trials at the Target
Center. I believe there is a bus stop close to your place.
If you have any recommendations, please let us know.

Also, my son is allergic to animals so if you have animals
in your place, we may have to find somewhere else to stay.
Thanks so much & will be in touch.

Thanks,
Sheila
